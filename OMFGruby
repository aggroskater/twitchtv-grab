Did I mention I'm also a Systems Administrator? It would be bad form if I
just gave up on getting ruby working.

Anyway, NOW WE KNOW:

 * The tracker requires ruby 1.9.x
 * The tracker is written in ruby (on rails)
 * The tracker utilizes Bundler for gem handling ($ bundle Gemfile)
 * The tracker utilizes a web framework called Sinatra
 * The tracker can be deployed via apache with passenger phusion, an
apache module that handles running ruby apps (not sure how rack and rake
fit into this scenario yet)

I utilized RVM to install ruby 1.9.3 on a CentOS 6.5 box and set it as the
default for each user (run `rvm use 1.9.3 --default` for each user). Then
installed bundle and passenger gems as root( `gem install bundle && gem
install passenger`). Then ran `bundle Gemfile` as user in the app dir, which
grabbed lots of gemfiles the app needed to run. Then I ran
`passenger-install-apache2-module` as root, which handled compiling the
mod_passenger.so module and told me how to edit the apache conf appropriately.

After all that mess, I think I've got the tracker running.

Bonus points: It's the latest tracker from source.

Did I mention I hate ruby?

UPDATE: Well, something's going wrong in the app when it tries to get
the ruby redis-client to eval() some long, complex query. Probably
because I don't have a lot of the data in there that it's looking for.
